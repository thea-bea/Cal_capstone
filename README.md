# Cal Master's Captsone

This is my capstone project for my MPH. I explored the relationship between primary maternity-care provider type (OBGYN, CNM, etc.) and patients' self-reported screening for postpartum depression (PPD).

## Data

I used publicly available data from [Listening to Mothers in California](https://www.chcf.org/collection/listening-to-mothers-in-california/).
